# Hosting
Hosting LibreX should be easy since no 3rd party PHP libs are used.<br/><br/>
If you want to host it just for yourself a PHP development server should be enough:
```
git clone https://github.com/hnhx/librex.git
cd librex
sudo php -S 127.0.0.1:80
```
<br/>
If you want to host an online instance you should consider using a production web server (e.g.: nginx).
