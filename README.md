# Hosting
Hosting LibreX should be easy since no 3rd party PHP libs are used.<br/>
All you need is PHP with the curl and dom extension enabled.<br/><br/>
If you want to host it just for yourself a PHP development server should be enough:
```
git clone https://github.com/hnhx/librex.git
cd librex
sudo php -S 127.0.0.1:80
```
<br/>
If you want to host an online instance you should consider using a production web server (e.g.: nginx).

# API
Example API request: `.../api.php?q=gentoo&p=2&type=0` <br/><br/>
`q` is the keyword<br/>`p` is the result page (the first page is `0`)<br/>`type` is the search type (`0`=text, `1`=image, `2`=video, `3`=torrent)
<br/><br/>
The API also supports both POST and GET requests.
